// Lab1(JavaScript Variables)
//EXERCISE 1: The Fortune Teller
//Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself? Store the following into variables: job title, geographic location, annual salary, company name. Output your fortune to the console like so: "You will be a X in Y, making $N for Z."

let jobTitle = "CEO";

let geographicLocation ="New York";

let annualSalary = 50000;

let companyName = "SanDisk";

console.log(`You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geographicLocation}, making ${annualSalary} for ${companyName}`);


//EXERCISE 2: The Age Calculator
//Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it! Store the current year in a variable. Store their birth year in a variable. Calculate their age based on the stored values. Output them to the console like so: "They are NN years old.", substituting the values.

let currentYear = 2020;

let birthYear = 1992;

console.log(`They are ${currentYear - birthYear} years old.`);

//EXERCISE 3: The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more! Store your current age into a variable. Store a maximum age into a variable. Store an estimated amount per day (as a number). Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life. Output the result to the console like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

let currentAge = 27;

let maximumAge = 100;

let estimatedAmount = 3;

let totalNeeded = (estimatedAmount * 365) * (maximumAge - currentAge);

console.log(`You will need ${totalNeeded} to last you until the ripe old age of ${maximumAge}`);


//EXERCISE 4: The Geometrizer
//Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here. Store a radius into a variable. Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN". Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

let radius = 4;

let circumference = Math.PI * 2*radius;

let area = Math.PI * radius * radius;

console.log(`The circumference is ${circumference}`);

console.log(`The area is ${area}`);


//EXERCISE 5: The Temperature Converter
//It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here. Store a celsius temperature into a variable. Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".  Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable. Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

let celsius = 20;

let celsiusToF = celsius * 9/5 + 32;

let fahrenheit = 75;

let fahrenToC = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9;


console.log(`20°C is ${celsiusToF}°F`);

console.log(`75°F is ${fahrenToC}°C`)



//Lab2(Javascript Functions)
// EXERCISE 1
// Write a function named squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

function squareNumber(a){

let square = Math.pow(a, 2);

    console.log(`The result of squaring the number ${a} is ${square}`);    
    
}

squareNumber(3);

// EXERCISE 2
// Write a function named halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".


function halfOf(num) {

    let half = num / 2;
    
    console.log(`Half of ${num} is  ${half}`);
    
    return half;
}

halfOf(5);


// EXERCISE 3
// Write a function named percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

function percentOf(number1, number2){
    
    let percent = number1 / number2 * 100;

    console.log(`${number1} is ${percent} % of ${number2}`);

    return percent;
}

percentOf(5, 10);

// EXERCISE 4
// Write a function named areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
//      Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.

function areaOfCircle(radius){
    
    let area= Math.PI * radius * radius;

    console.log(`The area for a circle with a radius of 2 is ${area}`);

    return area;

    
}

// EXERCISE 5
// Write a function named runAll that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier
//      1. Take half of the number and store the result.
//      2. Square the result of #1 and store that result. 
//      3. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.   
//      4. Calculate what percentage that area (#3) is of the squared result (#2).


function runAll(num){

    let half    = halfOf(num);
    let squared = Math.pow(half, 2); //16
    let area    = Math.PI *squared *squared; //
